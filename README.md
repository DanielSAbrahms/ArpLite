# ArpLite

This is a project idea I've had for years. The idea for an intuitive application for making light presentations for music. Music always gives me visuals, and the ability to create an entertaining sequence with something a simple as 5 multicolor lights, would involve an application very precise and easy to use. I want to be usable for anyone, without any knowledge of lighting or sequencing for music shows. 

It is still being conceptulized, but this repo will be cleared before development.
